    <a class= "FAQAnchor" href = "javascript:show(1)">1. Where does the JavaScript in a webpage come from?</a>
    <div id="answer1" class="Answer">
        <p>The JavaScript in a webpage comes from the server, like the rest of the webpage. 
        It can also be found in the head section of a webpage in script tags or at the bottom 
        of the page before the closing tags of body. This will mean that the JavaScript will 
        load after everything else like graphics, styles etc., so it would run smother.  Also 
        in an external document (myJavaDcript.js). You would put this line in the head section 
        for the javascript to run from an external file.</p>

<div class='Container'>
    <a class= "FAQAnchor" href = "javascript:show(2)">2. Where and how does JavaScript typically run?</a>
    <div id="answer2" class="Answer">
        <p>JavaScript is running in the browser on the client side, it runs after the 
        server has given the website, and as soon as the website is loaded and it will 
        continue to run if the user keeps on using events like moving mouse, clicking or 
        typing, as JavaScript is listening for these events. </br></br>
        The way the JavaScript runs on a website is by built in JavaScript engines in the browser. 
        The built in engines are also known as the built-in interpreter. Their job is to find the code, 
        read it and execute it. Different browsers have different engines that read JavaScript, for example:
        <ul>
        <li>Google Chrome uses an engine called V8</li>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox uses 3 engines these are Gecko layout engine, SpiderMonkey, and Rhino</li>
        <li>Safari uses an engine called Nitro </li>
        </ul>
 </p>
        <p  class = 'Close' onclick="hide(2)" style ='text-align:center'>Close</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class='Container'>
    <a  class= "FAQAnchor"href = "javascript:show(3)">3. What are the different ways in which JavaScript code can be initiated in a web browser?</a>
    <div id="answer3" class="Answer">
        <p>There are many ways you can initiate JavaScript in a web browser, and they can be used on any element, some of these are:
        
            <img src="../Img/Q3.png" />
        </br>
        After you have chosen the event that you want the JavaScript to be initiated you then need to put the name of the thing you 
        want to initiate, most likely it would be a function. 
        </p>

    <a class= "FAQAnchor" href = "javascript:show(4)">4. Is JavaScript a procedural language? If so give an example.</a>
    <div id="answer4" class="Answer">
        <p>Yes as you can declare functions, and that what procedural programing is about making the most out of reusing code 
        and making it easy to follow and reduce the number of code. In JavaScript you write the code in an organised way buy
         writing it in blocks of code called functions. This way it is easy to maintain and reuse. 
         This is an example of 2 function that are used in this page the first on is to open links and the second is to close links.

    </div>

<div class='Container'>
    <a  class= "FAQAnchor" href = "javascript:show(5)">5. Is JavaScript an object oriented language? If so, give an example.</a>
    <div id="answer5" class="Answer">
        <p>JavaScript is an object oriented as you can create new object, like Arrays. The example below shows how to 
        create new arrays and assign string to variables. When creating an array you create an instance of an object. 
        When assigning a string to an variable to assign all of its property with the text, meaning that this is now an
         object.

    </div>

<div class='Container'>
    <a class= "FAQAnchor" href = "javascript:show(6)">6. Is JavaScript an event-driven language? If so, give an example.</a>
    <div id="answer6" class="Answer">
        <p>JavaScript is an event-driven language as you have triggers that when triggered they 
        initiate an JavaScript function.  Some of triggers are:
        
            <img src="../Img/Q3.png" />
      
         </br>
         You can also use event listeners in JavaScript that will trigger an function. This way 
         is better as you can have the same event for all of p tags. This would save memory as there would be less code.

   <a  class= "FAQAnchor" href = "javascript:show(7)">7. What sort of things can I do with JavaScript?</a>
    <div id="answer7" class="Answer">
        <p>With JavaScript there are many things you can do with it, for example you can:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Make things interactive like links, images, paragraphs etc.</li>
        <li>animate graphics, create animations this is an example of animation created by JavaScript and HTML 
        <a href = "http://www.craftymind.com/factory/html5video/CanvasVideo.html" target="_blank"> Animation </a> </li>
        <li>manipulate cookies </li>
        <li>validating inputs if they are empty  </li>
        <li>create a game  these are two example of games -

    <div id="answer8" class="Answer">
        <p>  <a class= "FAQAnchor" href = "http://crimetimeline.io/" target="_blank">Crime timeline</a> - It is a project from developers 
            at agency Cyber-Duck that uses public APIs to pull in data about crime in Britain and enables
             the user to review their local area.</br>
            <a class= "FAQAnchor" href = "http://browserquest.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">BrowserQuest</a> - BrowserQuest is an RPG video game created by Little Workshop for 
            Mozilla, it uses HTML5 and technologies such as WebSockets, which can support hundreds or even thousands 
            of simultaneous users interacting."The primary goal was to show the capabilities of HTML5, JavaScript and 
            especially WebSockets," Guillaume Lecollinet of Little Workshop explained to .net.</br>
            <a class= "FAQAnchor" href = "http://www.drawastickman.com/" target="_blank">Draw a Stickma</a> - Draw a Stickman is virtual drawing pad which you can use your mouse 
            to create little doodles. It was created by Hitcents. Once the stickman is created it becomes animated 
            and walks around until it finds a box, and opens it. </br>

  <a  class= "FAQAnchor" href = "javascript:show(9)">9. Show me some examples of basic JavaScript syntax.</a>
    <div id="answer9" class="Answer">
        <p> This example shows a simple function and then used on the body when it runs, 
        it shows how to declare variables and create if statements. When this web page is 
        run a pop up box appears saying “Hello World” as the variable is equal to 1. 
        
            <img src="../Img/Q9Part1.png" />
        
        </br>

        This example just shows how you would create a for loop, it needs 3 attributes in the 
        brackets and then the code that will be repeated.

    <div id="answer10" class="Answer">
        <p>The code shows how to get an element from HTML and change the text in it and the colour of it in JavaScript.
         First of you need to create a paragraph tag for example and give it an id,
          then you can reference to that id in JS by fetching it and storing it in a 
          variable which then you can change the inner HTML and the colour and many more options.
