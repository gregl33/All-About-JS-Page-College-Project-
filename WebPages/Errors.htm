<h2 id="title">Common Errors</h2>
<br /><br />


<p>There are many common Errors made in JavaScript these are some of them: <br />
<ul>
     
   <li class="errors">Not using semicolons </li>
In JavaScript it is crucial that you put in semicolons after each statement as if 
you don’t then the JavaScript will not work and provide error. There is a JavaScript 
compiler that will put it for you but in some places it is necessary like in function, 
for-loops conditions otherwise you will receive an error.<br /><br />

<li class="errors">JavaScript is case sensitive</li>
When you get an error and don’t know what it is it might be that you have capitalized a 
function or variable name and they don’t match so it won’t work and this is a silent error.<br /><br />

<li class="errors">Equals signs</li>
Using too many or to little equals signs matters. You use one equal sign to assign a value 
to a variable and you use two equals’ signs to compare two values together. <br /><br />

<li class="errors">Don’t forget to close what you open</li>
whenever you open a statement or function you need to close it functions and if statements 
are opened and closed using curly brackets. Strings are closed and opened using quotation 
marks you can use single or double but if you open using single quotation you need to close 
using single. <br /><br />

<li class="errors">Not using var to declare variable</li>
if you don’t use var to declare variables this will make the variables global which you might
 want or might not, but this might become a sources of errors later on so always use var to declare 
 variables to keep them local.  <br /><br />
 <ul />
